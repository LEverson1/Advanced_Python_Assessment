# Advanced_Python_Assessment
This repository holds a text based application for storing and saving holiday data.
The jpg images show the handwritten planning process for the code. Whereas the Jupyter Notebooks file holds the created application.
The images are in order of the number in their name. Plans_1 before Plans_2 and so on.
This repository has been updated with altered code after help was received from the instructors.
