# Advanced_Python_Assessment
This repository holds the initial attempt at creating a text based application for storing and saving holiday data.
The jpg images show the handwritten planning process for the code. Whereas the Jupyter Notebooks file holds the created application.
The images are in order of the number in their name. Plans_1 before Plans_2 and so on.
This repository will be updated with altered code once help is received from the instructors.
